# DevOps Practices

## Infrastructure as Code (IaC)

### Kubernetes Manifests

- All infrastructure components defined declaratively in YAML
- Version-controlled configuration
- Repeatable deployments across environments

### Helm Charts

- Neo4j deployed using Helm for package management
- Configurable values for different environments
- Easy upgrades and rollbacks

## Continuous Deployment Ready

### Pipeline Structure

```
Code Commit → Build → Test → Deploy to Dev → Deploy to Prod
```

### GitHub Actions Configuration

```yaml
# CI/CD pipeline automates:
# - Docker image builds
# - Kubernetes manifest validation
# - Deployment to test environment
# - Integration testing
```

## Monitoring & Observability

### Health Checks

```yaml
# Liveness and readiness probes
livenessProbe:
  httpGet:
    path: /health
    port: 8080
  initialDelaySeconds: 30
  periodSeconds: 10
```

### Resource Management

- CPU and memory limits defined for all containers
- Horizontal Pod Autoscaling configuration ready
- Quality of Service classes implemented

## Security Best Practices

### Namespace Isolation

- Separate namespace for Kafka components
- Network policies for inter-service communication
- Service accounts with minimal permissions

### Security Contexts

```yaml
securityContext:
  runAsNonRoot: true
  runAsUser: 1000
  allowPrivilegeEscalation: false
  capabilities:
    drop:
      - ALL
```

## Automation & Scripting

### Deployment Automation

- Single-command deployment script
- Environment-specific configurations
- Rollback capabilities

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# deploy.sh - Automated deployment
kubectl apply -f infrastructure/ -n kafka
kubectl wait --for=condition=ready pod -l app.kubernetes.io/name=kafka -n kafka
```

### Testing Automation

- Infrastructure validation tests
- End-to-end pipeline tests
- Performance benchmarking

## Scalability & Resilience

### High Availability

- Kafka configured with multiple replicas
- Neo4j with persistent storage
- Pod disruption budgets

### Disaster Recovery

- Regular backups of Neo4j data
- Kafka topic replication
- Configuration stored in version control

## GitOps Practices

### Branching Strategy

```
main → production deployment
develop → staging deployment
feature/ → development branches
```

### Pull Request Process

1. Code changes in feature branch
2. Automated testing in CI pipeline
3. Peer review and approval
4. Automated deployment to staging
5. Manual promotion to production

## Production Readiness Checklist

- [x] Health checks implemented
- [x] Resource limits defined
- [x] Logging configuration
- [x] Monitoring setup
- [x] Backup procedures
- [x] Disaster recovery plan

## Performance Optimization

### Resource Allocation

- Right-sized containers based on profiling
- JVM tuning for Kafka brokers
- Neo4j memory configuration optimized

### Networking

- Service mesh ready (Istio/Linkerd)
- Network policies for security
- Load balancing configuration

This project demonstrates enterprise-grade DevOps practices suitable for production environments.
